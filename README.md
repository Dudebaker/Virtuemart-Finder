# Virtuemart Finder Package for Joomla Smart-Search

Virtuemart does not have Smart Search plugins for the newer in Joomla integrated Search-Engine.

Here is a complete package which contains all necessary plugins to add Virtuemart products, categories and manufacturers entries to the Finder Index and automatically update it upon changes in Virtuemart.

Since for some actions the Virtuemart-Core does not have any events (publish/unpublish/save,delete manufacturer), these specific events where realized with a system helper plugin.

---

The Finder Virtuemart Products plugin does have some additional settings to use the parent image/category/product if the child does not have anything assigned

---

### After the installation you have to enable all plugins!

---

### Tested with Virtuemart 4.2 and Joomla 4.4
